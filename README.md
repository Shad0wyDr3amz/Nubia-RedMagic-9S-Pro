this is the initial setup for the Nubia Red Magic 9S Pro to be able to build from source.
everything that is here was built using a system dump and files extracted from the device except for hardware/nubia.

hardware/nubia was obtained from https://github.com/LineageOS/android_hardware_nubia

the system dump is available here https://dumps.tadiphone.dev/dumps/nubia/nx769j

kernel(6.1.25) was obtained here https://download.ztedevices.com/device/global/support/opensource/2/20240408_02/NX769J-Android14-kernel(6.1.25).tar.gz#W3

vendor files were pulled directly from my device
